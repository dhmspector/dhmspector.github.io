			<h1>About</h1>

<p>I've been writing software for a long time.  Probably since before
you were born. No, for realz. I've worked in academia (at NYU), for
large computer companies like Digital Equipment Corp (DEC) and SUN,
been one of the highest billed consultants on Wall St. at dozens of
firms in the late-1980s, and was a VP, Sr VP and Managing Director at
really large banks & brokerages like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Bear
Stearns.  I've developed and run my own start-ups and been a consultant
and indie developer for many years.  </p>
