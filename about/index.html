			<h1>About</h1>

<p>I've been writing software for a long time.  Probably since before
you were born. No, seriously, like for realz. I've worked in academia (at
NYU), for large computer companies like Digital Equipment Corp (DEC)
and SUN, been one of the highest billed consultants on Wall St. at
dozens of firms in the late-1980s, and was a VP, Sr VP and Managing
Director at really large banks & brokerages like JPMorgan, Citigroup,
and Bear Stearns.  I've developed and run my own start-ups and been a
consultant to VC and tech firms and an indie developer for many
years.  </p>

<p>
What can I do for you?  Perhaps many things. Among other things, I....
