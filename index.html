			<h1>zeitgeist |ˈtsītˌgīst, ˈzīt-|</h1>

<p><em>noun.</em></br> the defining spirit
or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and
beliefs of the time: "<em>...bell-bottoms, flower-power,
Woodstock, anti-war sit-ins, and the heroic struggle for civil rights:
the iconic sights, sounds and movements that captured the zeitgeist of
the late-1960s.</em>"</p>

<p>Yeah, Ok, we get it; it's pretty cool name ...so who does this
cleverly named site belong to?</p>


<p>Well, my name is <em>David Spector</em>. I write software (mostly iOS and
OSX, but some other infrastructure-y/sytems-y stuff too). I think
about and create things that turn bits of the present into a vision of
the future.  ...I also often wield a soldering iron with which I
create interesting autonomous/networked wireless hardware, software
and sensor systems. In another part of my life I roast <em>trés</em>
high-end artisanal coffee and do pretty amazing things with a
smoker. But that's another story (well, and maybe another site...). </p>

<p> I'm a recovering New Yorker living the dream in
San Francisco.  <a href="/about">Read more than you probably want to
know about me...</a></p>
