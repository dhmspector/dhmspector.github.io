			<h1>zeitgeist |ˈtsītˌgīst, ˈzīt-|</h1>

<p>a<em>noun.</em></br> the defining spirit
or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and
beliefs of the time: "<em>...bell-bottoms, flower-power,
Woodstock, anti-war sit-ins, and the heroic struggle for civil rights:
the iconic sights, sounds and movements that captured the zeitgeist of
the late-1960s.</em>"</p>

<p>I write software (mostly iOS and OSX). I think and write about how
to turn bits of the present into a vision of the future. I roast
high-end specialty coffees. I am quite adept with a smoker.
...<em>and</em> a soldering iron: I design interesting
autonomous/networked wireless hardware, software and sensor systems.
I'm a recovering New Yorker living the dream in San
Francisco.  <a href="/about">Read more than you probably want to know
