<p>What. On. Earth. Is. A. 'Zeitgeist'..? Well, it's
a<em>noun.</em></br> It's most clearly defined as "the defining spirit
or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and
beliefs of the time," for example: "<em>...bell-bottoms, flower-power,
Woodstock, anti-war sit-ins, and the heroic struggle for civil rights:
the iconic sights, sounds and movements that captured the zeitgeist of
the late-1960s.</em>"</p>

<p>I write software (mostly iOS and OSX). I think and write about how
to turn bits of the present into a vision of the future. I roast
high-end specialty coffees. I design interesting autonomous hardware,
software and sensor systems.  I'm a recovering New Yorker living the
dream in San Francisco.  <a href="/about">Read more than you probably
